### Jquery Plugins, Templates, and Build Tools. Oh My!

This session we are covering:

* How to write a [jQuery plugin](http://plugins.jquery.com/)
* What client side templating systems are, what is out there, and how to use [mustache](http://mustache.github.com/)/[handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
* A basic intro to [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)

We are going to talk about these things and implement them on our [Give a Mile](http://giveamile.org) project.
